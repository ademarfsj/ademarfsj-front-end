                    This website is running in a kubernetes cluster with 3 Raspberry Pi, seriously!

                    Yeah, I know this is like using a bazooka to kill an ant, but I made this mainly to learn kubernetes
                    and now I have a cluster to put some personal apps available through the internet without having to pay new servers.

                    Check out my boys (rocket-raccoon, groot and star-lord). They are 3 Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB ram each, running Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit).

                    Before starting this project I knew I was going to learn some new things but the learning curve went way beyond what I was imagining it would be.  
                    I learned a lot about networks, kubernetes, docker, jenkins, linux and even how to get out of vi.

                    This was a super fun project to do and it was totally worth it.
