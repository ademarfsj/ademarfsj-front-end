                    I'm a web developer with solid knowledge in Java and I never found it difficult to learn new technologies.
                <br>
                    Working as developer since 2014 I've gone through several languages and frameworks to meet needs 
                    that have arisen, such as swift for iOS apps and Node.js for a simple and super light web app.
                <br>
                    I'm what some people call a full stack developer, I program both in frontend and backend, 
                    but I really like the backend. It's great to see things working well even if they don't have a face.
